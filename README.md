# Maverik Time Series Forecasting Project

## Business Problem and Objective
Maverik, a leading retail convenience store chain with a robust presence spanning over 400 locations across the western United States, recently bolstered its portfolio by acquiring Kum & Go, effectively doubling its store count. Positioned as the go-to destination for customers embarking on adventures, Maverik strives to be the premier choice for all needs, be it refueling with gas or acquiring essentials from the store. Boasting recent exponential growth, the company is keen on sustaining this momentum by ambitiously unveiling approximately 30 new stores annually. Consequently, Maverik recognizes the pivotal role of meticulous planning to provide accurate daily forecasts for a new store's inaugural year. This strategic foresight is instrumental in facilitating well-informed financial decision-making and enhancing the precision of initial Return on Investment (ROI) projections. The primary objective of the undertaken project was to develop a sophisticated model capable of generating daily forecasts for Maverik's four key sales metricsâ€”namely, inside sales, food sales, unleaded gallons, and diesel gallons. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the model's functionality was its adaptability to seamlessly update forecasts in real-time as new data became available, ensuring ongoing relevance and accuracy.
