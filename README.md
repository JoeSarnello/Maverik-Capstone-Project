# Maverik Time Series Forecasting Project

## Business Problem and Objective
Maverik, a leading retail convenience store chain with a robust presence spanning over 400 locations across the western United States, recently bolstered its portfolio by acquiring Kum & Go, effectively doubling its store count. Positioned as the go-to destination for customers embarking on adventures, Maverik strives to be the premier choice for all needs, be it refueling with gas or acquiring essentials from the store. Boasting recent exponential growth, the company is keen on sustaining this momentum by ambitiously unveiling approximately 30 new stores annually. Consequently, Maverik recognizes the pivotal role of meticulous planning to provide accurate daily forecasts for a new store's inaugural year. This strategic foresight is instrumental in facilitating well-informed financial decision-making and enhancing the precision of initial Return on Investment (ROI) projections. The primary objective of the undertaken project was to develop a sophisticated model capable of generating daily forecasts for Maverik's four key sales metricsâ€”namely, inside sales, food sales, unleaded gallons, and diesel gallons. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the model's functionality was its adaptability to seamlessly update forecasts in real-time as new data became available, ensuring ongoing relevance and accuracy.
## Group's Solution
Our project methodology involved conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, followed by an exhaustive exploration of various modeling approaches. During the EDA phase, we discerned distinct patterns within Maverik's data, including noticeable seasonality, the impact of specific days of the week, and the influence of holidays on sales. Recognizing the significance of capturing these nuances, our model development process prioritized the incorporation of these factors. Additionally, meticulous data cleaning and proficient handling of missing values were integral to ensuring the reliability of our models.

Our group employed a diverse set of models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, SARIMA, ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as the most effective, delivering superior results based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Collaborating closely with Maverik, we aligned our model performance with their stipulated threshold RMSE values, and, for the most part, our model surpassed these benchmarks. In conclusion, our meticulously crafted model not only provides accurate daily forecasts but also outperformed the predefined thresholds set by Maverik, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in predicting sales outcomes.
## Personal Contribution
Collaboratively, our group adopted a strategy where each member conducted their own Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and developed distinct models. Specifically, my assigned models were Linear Regression and Random Forest. While these models did not exhibit the optimal performance, a pivotal shift occurred when the group collectively determined that the XGBoost model offered the most promising results. In response, I actively contributed to leveraging the strengths of the XGBoost model to enhance our forecasting capabilities and refine our end results. My involvement extended beyond model development; I played a key role in shaping the presentation by crafting the introduction and incorporating essential data, including final RMSE values and outcomes.

Throughout the semester, I consistently attended all group meetings, offering valuable insights and suggestions that enriched our discussions. Towards the project's conclusion, I took on increased responsibilities, actively participating in gathering output results and ensuring the overall quality of our presentation. This heightened engagement underscored my commitment to the project's success and my dedication to enhancing the team's collective achievements.
## Business Value of Solution
In our presentation, we delivered substantial business value through our solution, presenting yearly forecasted summed dollar values for each of the four crucial metrics. Additionally, we offered strategic recommendations concerning the physical attributes of potential new locations, aiming to optimize revenue generation. Notable suggestions included a minimum square footage of 4970, a provision of at least 25 parking spaces, and a configuration of at least 19 traditional fueling stations.

We firmly believe that the application of our model and insights can effectively address Maverik's business challenges by fostering well-informed financial decision-making and refining the accuracy of initial Return on Investment (ROI) projections. Our holistic approach, encompassing both financial forecasting and strategic site recommendations, positions our solution as a valuable tool for Maverik to navigate its expansion and operational decisions with confidence and precision.
## Challenges
Our group encountered several challenges, primarily centered around effective communication and coordinating meeting times within our busy schedules. Given that this was our inaugural endeavor into a time series forecasting project, we grappled with initial difficulties, particularly in comprehending and addressing the seasonality inherent in the data. Consequently, our model faced challenges in accurately capturing and accounting for this temporal pattern.

Despite these obstacles, the team ultimately rallied and collaborated effectively, overcoming communication hurdles and gaining a better grasp of the intricacies of time series forecasting. In the culmination of our efforts, we successfully navigated through these challenges and brought the project to a successful conclusion.
## Key Learnings from the Project
In my current role at the company I work for, our focus revolves around utilizing historical and current data to generate reports that depict the health or status of specific elements. Engaging in this project provided me with a valuable firsthand experience of prediction and forecasting for a company. Over the course of the project, I honed my skills in constructing forecasting models and gained a deeper understanding of the business value they bring.

This endeavor underscored the significance of effective communication and highlighted the pitfalls of procrastination, especially when collaborating within a team. These lessons not only contributed to my development as a more proficient analyst but also enhanced my collaborative skills, making me a more effective team member. As a result, this project has significantly contributed to my professional growth, shaping me into a more adept and well-rounded analyst.
