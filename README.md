# Maverik Time Series Forecasting Project

## Business Problem and Objective
Maverik, a leading retail convenience store chain with a robust presence spanning over 400 locations across the western United States, recently bolstered its portfolio by acquiring Kum & Go, effectively doubling its store count. Positioned as the go-to destination for customers embarking on adventures, Maverik strives to be the premier choice for all needs, be it refueling with gas or acquiring essentials from the store. Boasting recent exponential growth, the company is keen on sustaining this momentum by ambitiously unveiling approximately 30 new stores annually. Consequently, Maverik recognizes the pivotal role of meticulous planning to provide accurate daily forecasts for a new store's inaugural year. This strategic foresight is instrumental in facilitating well-informed financial decision-making and enhancing the precision of initial Return on Investment (ROI) projections. The primary objective of the undertaken project was to develop a sophisticated model capable of generating daily forecasts for Maverik's four key sales metricsâ€”namely, inside sales, food sales, unleaded gallons, and diesel gallons. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the model's functionality was its adaptability to seamlessly update forecasts in real-time as new data became available, ensuring ongoing relevance and accuracy.
## Group's Solution
Our project methodology involved conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, followed by an exhaustive exploration of various modeling approaches. During the EDA phase, we discerned distinct patterns within Maverik's data, including noticeable seasonality, the impact of specific days of the week, and the influence of holidays on sales. Recognizing the significance of capturing these nuances, our model development process prioritized the incorporation of these factors. Additionally, meticulous data cleaning and proficient handling of missing values were integral to ensuring the reliability of our models.

Our group employed a diverse set of models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, SARIMA, ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as the most effective, delivering superior results based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Collaborating closely with Maverik, we aligned our model performance with their stipulated threshold RMSE values, and, for the most part, our model surpassed these benchmarks. In conclusion, our meticulously crafted model not only provides accurate daily forecasts but also outperformed the predefined thresholds set by Maverik, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in predicting sales outcomes.
